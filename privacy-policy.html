        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This research survey and website analytics are conducted and managed by Mark Denzel Matzke (“We”, “Us” or “I”) as part of independent research and data collection activities. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and general best practices in online research and analytics.</p>

        <p>This policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and how you can control your data. It applies solely to this website and any surveys hosted or linked here. For information on other websites that you may access through links from this site, please refer to their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h3>1. Is Participation Voluntary?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Participation in any surveys or analytics-based activities is entirely voluntary. You may choose not to participate or to stop participation at any time without penalty.</p>

        <h3>2. What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
        <p>If you consent to participate in a survey, we may collect:</p>
        <p><strong>Survey Responses:</strong> The answers you provide in questionnaires or polls.</p>
        <p><strong>Basic Contact Data:</strong> If applicable, such as email addresses for incentives or follow-up.</p>
        <p><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, browser type, screen resolution, and IP address. This technical data may be used to generate a unique identifier (“digital fingerprint”) to prevent duplicate submissions and to improve research quality.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Analytics Tracking:</strong><br>We use Google Analytics (GA4) to collect anonymous website usage data. This includes:</p>
        <p>Number of visitors</p>
        <p>Geographic location (country/region)</p>
        <p>Device type and browser information</p>
        <p>Pages visited and session duration</p>
        <p>Referring sources (search engines, direct, or other websites)</p>
        <p>Google Analytics collects this data using cookies and similar technologies. No personal identifying information is collected via GA4 unless explicitly provided by you.</p>

        <h3>3. How We Use the Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Research Purposes:</strong> Your survey responses are used exclusively for research analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Technical data ensures accurate reporting, prevents duplicate responses, and maintains survey integrity.</p>
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> Aggregate, anonymized website metrics are used to improve the website and user experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Incentives & Prizes:</strong> If applicable, your contact information may be used to deliver survey rewards or enter prize draws.</p>
        <p>We do not sell or share your personal data for marketing purposes or with third parties for advertising. Any sub-contractors or service providers involved (e.g., Google Analytics) are contractually bound to comply with privacy and security obligations.</p>

        <h3>4. Children’s Data</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

        <h3>5. Retention of Data</h3>
        <p>Survey responses and identifying information are retained only as long as necessary for research purposes, usually a maximum of 12 months after project completion.</p>
        <p>Anonymized research results may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.</p>
        <p>Information collected for incentives or prize fulfillment is kept for a maximum of 1 year.</p>

        <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
